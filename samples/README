# Mini-Kairo
Mini-Kairo is a lightweight proof-of-concept security scanner
for Solidity smart contracts.

It detects common vulnerabilities during development, simulating
real-time security feedback similar to AI-native IDEs like Kairo.

## Detected Issues
- Reentrancy via low-level calls
- Unchecked external calls
- tx.origin usage

## Usage
python scanner.py samples/vulnerable.sol

## Note
This is intentionally simple and rule-based, designed to demonstrate
security thinking and developer workflow alignment — not to replace
full auditors.
